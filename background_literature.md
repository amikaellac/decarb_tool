| 15099.01_ SOCP Marine Vessel Energy Efficiency |       Energy Efficieny White Paper |          115 |     Improving efficiency of ships by modifying vessel parts and designs to reduce draft and drag. Incorporating renewable energy resources such as wind, waves and sun to lessen oil usage. Proposal on using mechanical and Electrical systems to increase energy efficiency of vessels through use of different batteries, natural gas, engines and generators. Modifying operational practices through fuel consumption monitors, efficient weather routing, optimizing voyage routes and cleaning/maintaining hull.   |

| Assessment-IMO-DecarbonizationPlan   |              Journal of Cleaner Production        |    13     | BBased on the performance of the sample ships regarding the IMO short-term measures indicates that compliance is not straightforward and costly. This is true for older ships or those that have already installed several compliance options under the CII rating. Compared to younger ships, older ones face higher obstacles due to their design, EPL is  the  most cost-effective option, but  low  MCR levels might substantially increase sailing times. |
| Bouman-ReviewGHGReductionShips-2017      | State-of-the-Art technologies, measures and potential for redcucing GHG emissions from shipping  | 14   | Results of the research indicate that no single measure is sufficient by itself to reach considerable sector-wide reductions; however, over 75% of emission reduction is achievable by swift adoption and combination of individual dependent and independent measures. The overall success of these emissions reductions technologies and measures are dependent on the growth rates of maritime transport as well as the policies, regulations, and legislation, can facilitate reduction of GHG emissions by the sector. Successful implementation has to be supported by high-quality studies addressing multiple effects and measures simultaneously in order to avoid counteracting and inefficient adoption of mitigation measures. |
