| Assessment-IMO-DecarbonizationPlan   |              Journal of Cleaner Production        |    13     | BBased on the performance of the sample ships regarding the IMO short-term measures indicates that compliance is not straightforward and costly. This is true for older ships or those that have already installed several compliance options under the CII rating. Compared to younger ships, older ones face higher obstacles due to their design, EPL is  the  most cost-effective option, but  low  MCR levels might substantially increase sailing times. |
| Bouman-ReviewGHGReductionShips-2017      | State-of-the-Art technologies, measures and potential for redcucing GHG emissions from shipping  | 14   | Results of the research indicate that no single measure is sufficient by itself to reach considerable sector-wide reductions; however, over 75% of emission reduction is achievable by swift adoption and combination of individual dependent and independent measures. The overall success of these emissions reductions technologies and measures are dependent on the growth rates of maritime transport as well as the policies, regulations, and legislation, can facilitate reduction of GHG emissions by the sector. Successful implementation has to be supported by high-quality studies addressing multiple effects and measures simultaneously in order to avoid counteracting and inefficient adoption of mitigation measures. |

| DecarbonizationShipping-Thesis-SUNY   |  Decarbonization of Shipping        | 91      | Electricity cannot be a solution for the movement of shipping; the batteries required to move huge tankers that sail for weeks would have to be huge. Even if the batteries were smaller, and relied on the wind or the sun to recharge at sea,the weather does not always move according to expectations. There will certainly be a use of wind and solar energy in the future, but this will be to move auxiliary systems, removing energy  weight  from  the  main  engine  of  the  ship. |

| ElectricPropulsionShips-CBO   | Electric-Drive Propulsion for U.S. Navy Ships: Background and Issues for Congress        | 61      | Electric-drive technology offers significant anticipated benefits for U.S. Navy ships in terms of reducing ship life-cycle cost, increasing ship stealthiness, payload, survivability, and power available for non-propulsion uses, and taking advantage of a strong electrical-power technological and industrial base. Pursuing electric-drive will incur higher near-term costs than a strategy that places continued emphasis on mechanical-drive technology. Estimates of the costs and benefits of electric-drive technology should arguably include measures that examine not just shorter-but also longer-term costs and warfighting effects.|

While The HED systems showed benefit in a 2013 business analysis, In 2020 the navy reported that in order to reap the benefits of these systems, it could take 14-81 years for the HED systems to save enough fuel to surpass costs. Furthermore, HED performance could only be characterized based on 82 hours of operational data. The navy did not provide information on why it's necessary to suspend the HED program.|
